# Documentation project instructions

## About this project

- This is a documentation site built on [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com)
- Pages are MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Configuration lives in `docs.json`
- Run `mint dev` to preview locally
- Run `mint broken-links` to check links

## About the product

- **chifu** is continuous security monitoring for live websites, aimed at
  "vibe-coders" who ship AI-built static Next.js sites (Lovable, v0, Bolt, Cursor)
  to Vercel. Lead with monitoring + alerts, not "run a manual scan".
- It is the monitoring product in the **Marshell** family. Company = Marshell,
  product = chifu, domain = `marshell.dev`, dashboard = `marshell.dev/dashboard`.
- Docs mirror what the dashboard actually does today. Dashboard surfaces:
  Overview, Scans, Findings, Schedule, Alerts, MCP (Workspace); Domains, Team
  (Resources); Settings, Docs (footer).
- Alerts (Discord webhook) live on their own dashboard Alerts page. API keys are
  created/managed on the dashboard MCP page (and one is shown once at signup).
  Note: the MCP onboarding doc keeps the `/ai-editor` slug because Mintlify
  reserves `/mcp`.

## Terminology

- Product name **chifu** is lowercase, even at the start of a sentence.
- "scan" (not "audit"), "finding" (not "issue"), "domain" (not "site/asset"),
  "verified domain" before it can be scanned.
- Severities: Critical, High, Medium, Low (and passive Info).
- Risk score is **0–99, higher is safer**; bands are Excellent / Good / Fair /
  Poor / Critical.
- Plans: **Free** (3 scans/mo), **Pro** ($7.99, 30/mo), **Max** ($23.99, 120/mo).
  Pro/Max are "coming soon" — don't imply they're purchasable yet.

## Style preferences

- Use active voice and second person ("you")
- Keep sentences concise — one idea per sentence
- Use sentence case for headings
- Bold for UI elements: Click **Settings**
- Code formatting for file names, commands, paths, and code references
- Friendly and reassuring: readers are not security experts. No unexplained jargon.
- Prefer `<Steps>`, `<Tabs>`, `<CardGroup>`, and callouts (`<Note>`/`<Tip>`/
  `<Warning>`) over walls of text.
- **No em-dashes anywhere.** Use periods, commas, colons, or parentheses instead.

## Content boundaries

- Document only shipped, working features. Mark "coming soon" things clearly
  (Pro/Max plans, Team page, Telegram alerts) rather than describing them as live.
- Don't document backend internals, the Go API source, or DB schema, only the
  user-facing REST surface (`POST /api/v1/scan`, `GET /api/v1/scans/{id}`).
